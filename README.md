# Mail Bites
Mail Bites is a unique, innovative application designed to revolutionize the way users interact with their emails, primarily aiming to reduce the time and effort spent checking emails.

## Features
### Email Summarization
Leveraging the power of the OpenAI API, Mail Bites will summarize emails into concise bullet-point summaries. This feature allows users to quickly absorb the key points without the need to read the entire email. Customization options are available to adjust the level of summarization based on user preferences and needs.

### Single-Email Focus
To avoid context-switching and maintain user focus, the interface is designed to display one email at a time. Once a user action is completed on an email - be it deleting, archiving, skipping, or replying - the email is replaced by the next one in the queue.

### Priority-Based Filtering
Mail Bites prioritizes user attention by only displaying unread emails under the 'primary' label. This cuts through the noise and clutter of less important or irrelevant emails.

### Minimized Distractions
The design philosophy revolves around minimizing distractions. The interface is clean, intuitive, and streamlined. Redundant information and unnecessary options are eliminated, leaving only the most crucial actions and details in view.

## Use Cases
Mail Bites is particularly beneficial for those with a busy inbox. If you frequently receive a large volume of emails and need to process them efficiently without distraction or overwhelm, Mail Bites offers a refreshing solution.

## Technologies Used
Mail Bites is built using modern web technologies, including JavaScript (Node.js and React), Express.js for the backend server, and the Gmail API for managing email interactions. For secure user authentication, the application uses Google OAuth 2.0.
