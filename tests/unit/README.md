# Unit Test Skeleton

Store unit tests inside this directory. Tests should focus on isolated logic (navigation hooks, view tracker, utility helpers) and rely on the Chrome API mocks registered in `tests/setup/vitest.setup.ts`.

Recommended naming: `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts`. Execute them with `npm run test:unit` or `npm run test:unit:watch`.
